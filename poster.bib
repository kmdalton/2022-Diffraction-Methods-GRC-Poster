	abstract = {The new European X-ray Free-Electron Laser is the first X-ray free-electron laser capable of delivering X-ray pulses with a megahertz inter-pulse spacing, more than four orders of magnitude higher than previously possible. However, to date, it has been unclear whether it would indeed be possible to measure high-quality diffraction data at megahertz pulse repetition rates. Here, we show that high-quality structures can indeed be obtained using currently available operating conditions at the European {XFEL}. We present two complete data sets, one from the well-known model system lysozyme and the other from a so far unknown complex of a β-lactamase from K. pneumoniae involved in antibiotic resistance. This result opens up megahertz serial femtosecond crystallography ({SFX}) as a tool for reliable structure determination, substrate screening and the efficient measurement of the evolution and dynamics of molecular structures using megahertz repetition rate pulses available at this new class of X-ray laser source.},

O2 formation takes place at a catalytic manganese cluster within milliseconds after the photosystem {II} reaction centre is excited by three single-turnover flashes. Here we present combined X-ray emission spectra and diffraction data of 2-flash (2F) and 3-flash (3F) photosystem {II} samples, and of a transient 3F’ state (250 μs after the third flash), collected under functional conditions using an X-ray free electron laser. The spectra show that the initial O–O bond formation, coupled to Mn reduction, does not yet occur within 250 μs after the third flash. Diffraction data of all states studied exhibit an anomalous scattering signal from Mn but show no significant structural changes at the present resolution of 4.5 Å. This study represents the initial frames in a molecular movie of the structural changes during the catalytic reaction in photosystem {II}.},

	abstract = {Estimates of the quality of experimental maps are important in many stages of structure determination of macromolecules. Map quality is defined here as the correlation between a map and the corresponding map obtained using phases from the final refined model. Here, ten different measures of experimental map quality were examined using a set of 1359 maps calculated by re-analysis of 246 solved {MAD}, {SAD} and {MIR} data sets. A simple Bayesian approach to estimation of map quality from one or more measures is presented. It was found that a Bayesian estimator based on the skewness of the density values in an electron-density map is the most accurate of the ten individual Bayesian estimators of map quality examined, with a correlation between estimated and actual map quality of 0.90. A combination of the skewness of electron density with the local correlation of r.m.s. density gives a further improvement in estimating map quality, with an overall correlation coefficient of 0.92. The {PHENIX} {AutoSol} wizard carries out automated structure solution based on any combination of {SAD}, {MAD}, {SIR} or {MIR} data sets. The wizard is based on tools from the {PHENIX} package and uses the Bayesian estimates of map quality described here to choose the highest quality solutions after experimental phasing.},

In order to compute the electron density of the crystal which yields these reflections, the intensity of each reflection must be estimated. Redundant observations must be parsimoniously reduced to a set of summary intensities and corresponding error estimates. This task is confounded by a range of systematic effects leading to equivalent reflections being expressed on different scales. Here, we present a modern Bayesian solution to this problem, careless, which uses deep learning and variational inference to simultaneously merge and scale reflection observations. We successfully apply this method to conventional monochromatic X-ray diffraction data, polychromatic diffraction data, and finally X-ray free-electron laser data. Thereby, we find that this single model is generally applicable to many types of X-ray diffraction experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference ({VI}), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. {VI} has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind {VI} is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of {VI} applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in {VI} and highlight important open problems. {VI} is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

In a centrosymmetric crystal the probability of the structure amplitude of the hkl reflexion lying between F and F + {dF} is P(F) {dF}, where P(F) = (2{πΣ})½ exp\{−F2/2Σ\}, a result noticed empirically.

Other symmetry elements do not produce important effects on the general reflexions, but may make a zone or line of intensities behave as if centred or centrosymmetric. The mean value of I is Σ, a fact that can be used to put relative intensities on an absolute basis. The mean values of {\textbar}F{\textbar} or I2 can also be used, but the mean value of I is the only one independent of the symmetry. The difference between the ratios of 〈{\textbar}F{\textbar}〉2 or 〈I〉 for centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystals may serve for the purely X-ray determination of a centre of symmetry.},

A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss {AdaMax}, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},
